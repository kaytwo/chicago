# Frequencies

There is a folder for each ensemble. Each folder has three files:

-   `orderings.csv`: The number of occurrences of each ordering (e.g. "HWBA")
    over all wards in all plans in the ensemble.
-   `over_quarter.csv`: The frequencies of subcases (1M, 1P, 2M, 2P, 3M, 3P) for
    each ordering, where we use a threshold of 1/4.
-   `over_sixth.csv`: The frequencies of subcases (1M, 1P, 2M, 2P, 3M, 3P) for
    each ordering, where we use a threshold of 1/6.
